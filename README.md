When you perform Debruijn-Morselt transformations on a rooted tree of order n, how many different "orbits" are there, and what is the largest orbit for each order? The transformation and the notion of an orbit are described here: http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/17-3/shapiro.pdf

Running SurveyOrbits yields the following results (copied below):

I looked up the sequences of the number of orbits/largest orbits on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences and found that someone (namely, Antti Karttunen, the wily and industrious Finn) beat me to the chase 14 years ago based partly on a paper that my father coauthored in 1977: R. Donaghey & L. W. Shapiro, Motzkin numbers, J. Combin. Theory, Series A, 23 (1977), 291-301.
